This repository is for implementations of treewidth algorithms.

Currently, it contains the source code of the algorithms 
described in the following manuscript:

@misc{tamaki2021heuristic,
      title={A heuristic for listing almost-clique minimal separators of a graph}, 
      author={Hisao Tamaki},
      year={2021},
      eprint={2108.07551},
      archivePrefix={arXiv},
      primaryClass={cs.DS}
}

It includes an implementation of the exact algorithm for treewidth described in:

@inproceedings{tamaki2019computing,
  title={Computing treewidth via exact and heuristic lists of minimal separators},
  author={Tamaki, Hisao},
  booktitle={International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms},
  pages={219--236},
  year={2019},
  organization={Springer}
}

The main purposes of this repository are to make the published experimental results reproducible 
and to make the code available for research use. I plan to develop a production level implementations
in a few years. If you use the code in this repository in your research and
publish results from that research, 
please cite this repository and/or a relevant one of the above papers.
